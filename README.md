# react-course

This is the training repository for the beginner's react course by wes bos.

The specific "homework-files" according to the trello tasks can be found in the corresponding folders.

For anything related to the "moody-tasks" take a look into the [my-app Repository](https://github.com/Sav0narola/my-app)

For any Code created unrelated to moody, switch into the relevant feature branch (i.e. Branch: chp-3)
