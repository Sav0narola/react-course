IDE CHOICE = Webstorm:
	-lightweight
	-i am familiar with intelliJ Idea
	-i will learn how to use webstorm and will be familiar with another ide
	-i know ppl who work with webstorm
	-given the advices from my colleagues, VS-Code (ide of choice of the author of the course) wouldn't have been the optimal choice.
	-it is a widely used ide, so there is a lot of support and a big community

	the other choices of mine would've been either sublime or idea. while sublime simply can't compete with the richness of features of any ide (ignoring the fact that i would substitute an ide with an editor), IDea just brings too much of them. So i got the impression that webstorm would be the best choice, given my requirements and the available options, taking configuration effort and other non-functional factors into account.


	EDITOR CHOICE = Sublime.

	It is my Editor of Choice for everything at the moment. i simply saw no use in changing it for this course.
